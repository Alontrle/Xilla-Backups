# Xilla Backups

Xilla Backups is a differential backup solution made for scalability and performance. Designed to work directly with folders and ftp servers it offers easy setup with reliable backups and restorations. XIlla offers an advanced system that only stores updated files, so if a file has not changed it will refence the same file. This saves a lot of unnecessarily lost space. We offer compression and encryption as configurable options, these each have their respected benefits but will cost additional cpu and ram on said backup machines.<br>
